  m_TableData:
  - m_Id: 93221060608
    m_Localized: Wake up at 6, meetings until quitting time, work from quitting time
      until 11 PM.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032128
    m_Localized: Sleep at 1 AM, wake up at 6 again. Feeling averse to this.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032129
    m_Localized: Even if you enjoy work, wouldn't this be tough?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032130
    m_Localized: When I think it's tough, I wonder if I don't actually like work?
      Is it a lie?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032131
    m_Localized: It might be related to childhood work, but aren't we living to be
      happy? Honestly, I can't really empathize...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032132
    m_Localized: Don't put others down. If you envy someone's relationships, pursue
      that a bit more.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032133
    m_Localized: If you have envy or admiration, move towards getting closer to that.
      But don't get too caught up in it...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032134
    m_Localized: No matter how badly someone did something, isn't it not good to
      talk behind their back?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032135
    m_Localized: Hmm... I should try not to do that. But the irritation... Hearing
      things differently. Constantly picking faults.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032136
    m_Localized: Ugh... it's hard to take. Is it all because of lack of sleep? I've
      been lacking sleep lately...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032137
    m_Localized: I'm not that great myself, but I keep getting irritated. Shouldn't
      I reflect more?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032138
    m_Localized: I don't know why I have to worry about these things. Why are there
      so many impressive people?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032139
    m_Localized: In reality, these people might barely make up 10%. Looking around...
      people I'm not sure about...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032140
    m_Localized: I think it might be a problem of different times spent focusing
      or immersing, but since I'm the one seeing it now, honestly, I'm not sure.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032141
    m_Localized: People who live like they're all that must be hard to work with.
      Be less sensitive.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032142
    m_Localized: I seem to have become quite sensitive lately, let's take care of
      ourselves.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032143
    m_Localized: It's amazing to see people who are friendly with everyone. How do
      they live like that? It would be best to enjoy without thinking too much!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032144
    m_Localized: Woke up with my whole body soaked in sweat. Strange...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032145
    m_Localized: Usually I don't remember the content of my dreams, but only an unpleasant
      feeling remains. Did I have an unpleasant dream?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032146
    m_Localized: Having nightmares lately. Can't recall the content properly, but
      remember a few things I saw.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032147
    m_Localized: I wake up in my studio apartment, open the door to leave and enter.
      After passing through a dark place, I'm standing in the same room. Suffocating.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032148
    m_Localized: Every time I wake up, the feeling of my heart being squeezed is
      extremely unpleasant.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032149
    m_Localized: Couldn't do the work properly... Tasks are piling up, but I can't
      concentrate. My mind is tangled.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032150
    m_Localized: Even listening to music is difficult. It's inefficient. I think
      it might get better if I sleep, but I have nightmares every time I sleep.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032151
    m_Localized: The image of my grandmother from childhood keeps coming to mind.
      My body feels stuffy, and dark thoughts arise.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032152
    m_Localized: When I was young, sometimes in dreams I'd experience terrifying,
      unpleasant, chilling, horrifying things and end up wailing.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032153
    m_Localized: When I woke up, I'd find traces of having actually cried, half-awake.
      It feels like that's happening a lot lately.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032154
    m_Localized: I feel so heavy and suffocated. My head is dizzy, everything's a
      mess, and I feel nauseous. It's a dazed feeling, like I can't get a grip on
      anything.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032155
    m_Localized: When I play the cello, thoughts of my grandmother come to mind.
      Before that incident, when my parents were busy, I grew up under my grandmother's
      care.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032156
    m_Localized: In a way, maybe I took after my grandmother in playing the cello
      too. I'm grateful, but after that incident, and after grandmother passed away.
      It was quite difficult.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032157
    m_Localized: Lately, with the dreams and all, I often feel tired, listless, or
      startled. I wonder if it's related to my poor physical condition...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032158
    m_Localized: I couldn't properly cultivate my cello skills. Although I tried
      to avoid it, it's really awful to have humiliating moments with someone I usually
      looked down on a bit...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032159
    m_Localized: Both my body and mind are so tired these days. I thought I'd been
      through quite a lot of tough times.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032160
    m_Localized: But these days, it's harder because it's hard. It seems like more
      of these things are happening because I'm not in good condition.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032161
    m_Localized: Why is it like this even when there's nothing particularly difficult
      going on these days?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032162
    m_Localized: I can't do it anymore. When I try to play the cello or listen to
      the music I used to, it feels like my blood runs cold.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032163
    m_Localized: It's similar to when I spent time with my grandmother before. When
      grandmother started acting strange. It's similar to that time.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032164
    m_Localized: Grandmother also had nightmares at first. After that, her condition
      gradually worsened. She complained of headaches and chills similar to mine,
      and then suddenly became strange.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032165
    m_Localized: It was when I spent time with my grandmother as a child. That's
      also when I became interested in music and the cello.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032166
    m_Localized: I can't deny that it had a big influence, both good and bad.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032167
    m_Localized: At some point, grandmother started acting strange. Every time she
      woke up, she would scream or visibly weaken right away.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032168
    m_Localized: Or she would feel dizzy. At that time, I thought it was simply because
      she was getting old...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032169
    m_Localized: My parents were both too busy to properly understand grandmother's
      condition. Still, until that day, she was able to live normally.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032170
    m_Localized: But from some point on, even that became impossible. She would scream
      all day, or be in pain, as if everything had broken down.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032171
    m_Localized: Seeing my grandmother, who was an object of respect, in that state.
      A guardian who disappeared in an instant. The situation where I, young as I
      was, had to protect my grandmother remains.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032172
    m_Localized: At that time, I could only think negatively, but now when I think
      about it, these thoughts come to mind.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032173
    m_Localized: I'm somewhat okay when writing in my diary, but I can't go out much,
      can't do the music I've been doing until now, and thus can't do any productive
      activities.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032174
    m_Localized: I have no friends, and my parents are gone now. What value do I
      have, having lost all relationships and skills?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032175
    m_Localized: Writing this is proof that I haven't gone crazy. I can speak. I
      can breathe.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032176
    m_Localized: If there's no one else, I think I could live on. Rather than everyone
      disappearing, shouldn't I be the one to disappear?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032177
    m_Localized: There's something left in me who can't play the cello. Every time
      I hear music, a vague anxiety. A severe feeling of suffocation comes over me.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93242032178
    m_Localized: I found an old album. Photos taken with grandmother. Grandmother
      probably felt similar.
